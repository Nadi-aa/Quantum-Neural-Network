## General info 
We use IBM Quantum Composer to design a quantum circuit with 4 qubits that is capable of performing binary classification on a dataset with 4 features. To train our model we use 2 datasets:
- The CICIDS2017 Dataset
- "Significant Earthquakes, 1965-2016" from National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC)
	
## Setup
To make and run this project, we have used:
* IBM Quantum Composer 
* Kaggle

## IBM Quantum Composer generated circuit
